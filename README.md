#method

A suite of helper functions to help with unit testing.

These originally were produced due to having some trouble with the combiniation of [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [sinon](sinonjs.org),  [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) ajax calls.

Having recently started to use [Jasmine](jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) though these methods are less well used.
